# *The Source Must Flow*

## Preface

Kerbal Space Program (the first, **KSP¹** from now), since many, many years, is not "only a game" anymore: it's a Cultural Phenomena, a STEM advocate and an invite for the Younghood into the Science and Engineering careers.

Or just an infinite source of fun and amusement, filled with hours and hours of stupidly awesome accomplishments - between many more awesomely stupid ones. :) 

However, and for reasons out of the scope of this document, Time hasn't treated this marvellous game with kindness: it's some time since critical bugs were being introduced into the code base unchecked while new features were built over them, a (Sand) Castle being built over brittle foundations.

The situation, since the final 1.12.5 release, didn't improved.

This document aims to propose a solution: the (controlled) release of the Source Code to be inspected by the KSP¹ Community.
